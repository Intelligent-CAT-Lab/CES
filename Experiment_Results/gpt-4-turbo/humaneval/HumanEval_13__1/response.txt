[REASONING]
The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with (a = 144, b = 60).
The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
First Iteration:
    - a = 144, b = 60
    - `a, b = b, a % b` updates `a` to 60 and `b` to 144 % 60 = 24.
Second Iteration:
    - a = 60, b = 24
    - `a, b = b, a % b` updates `a` to 24 and `b` to 60 % 24 = 12.
Third Iteration:
    - a = 24, b = 12
    - `a, b = b, a % b` updates `a` to 12 and `b` to 24 % 12 = 0.
Since `b` is now 0, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `a`, which is now 12, the GCD of 144 and 60.
